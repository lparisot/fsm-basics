This is inspired by the [scxml specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/).
Yep, There is already a lot of state machine [implementations](https://projects.spring.io/spring-statemachine/) out there.
But we did not need a full blown state machine implementation (no compound states, No parallel state).
